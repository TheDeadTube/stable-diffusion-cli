# stable-diffusion-cli

These scripts provide an easy way to interact with the Stability AI API via a Linux command-line interface (CLI), with proper error-handling and logging as much information as possible about each image. Part of what spurred this project was that I kept losing track of what prompts, negative prompts, and seeds I had used per image.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `curl`: For making API requests.
- `jq`: For parsing JSON responses.
- `base64`: For decoding base64-encoded images.

Most Unix-like operating systems include these by default. If not, they can be installed through your package manager (e.g., apt for Ubuntu/Debian, brew for macOS).

## Setting Up Your Environment

You need a valid API key from [Stability AI](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started). Once obtained:

### Option 1: In Your Shell Profile

Define it in your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) on a new line, like so:

```bash
export STABILITY_AI_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

### Option 2: .env File

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as this script and add the following to the top of the file:

```bash
STABILITY_AI_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

 A file, `env_template` has been included for your convenience.

Ensure that either method is set up correctly so the script can authenticate with Stability AI's services.

## Usage

Usage will be broken down per script. More will be added as time goes on.

### sd3-txt2img.sh

For running text-to-image calls on Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion 3 Turbo.

To run the script:

```bash
./sd3-txt2img.sh [options]
```

Replace `[options]` with any command-line options detailed below.

#### Options

- `-p "prompt"`: *Required.* Sets the prompt for image generation. Must be between 1 and 10,000 characters in length.
- `-n "negative prompt"`: *Optional.* Sets the negative prompt for image generation. Note that only the `sd3` model supports a negative prompt. `sd3-turbo` does not. Cannot be more than 10,000 characters.
- `-s "integer value"`: *Optional.* Takes an integer value between `0` and `4294967294`.
- `-t "file type"`: *Optional.* Choices are `jpeg` and `png`. Default is `jpeg`.
- `-o "image name"`: *Optional.* The prefix to name your output image (and log file) with. A timestamp and the appropriate file extension will be automatically appended.
- `-m "model"`: *Optional.* Default is `sd3`. Choices are `sd3` and `sd3-turbo`.
- `-h`: Print the 'help' text.

## TODO / Roadmap

This section outlines planned enhancements and features we aim to implement. It serves as a rough roadmap for the project's development direction. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

- [ ] Add aspect ratio selection to `sd3-txt2img.sh`.
- [ ] Implement interactive mode in `sd3-txt2img.sh` for easier prompt input.
- [ ] Support for additional Stability AI models beyond sd3 and sd3-turbo.
- [ ] Add support for batch processing of multiple prompts.
- [ ] Test compatibility with Windows systems via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- [ ] Reticulate splines.
